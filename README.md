# QualityTraits_NIRS_Calibration

The actual repo contains an R workflow that allows to pull Nirs and quality traits Data using API calls,apply preprocessing and smoothing methods to spectral data, fit models, compare and visualize models predictions and performance metrics.
The Rshiny version of the workflow is initially allows data extraction based on user specifications of quality lab, crop, Country, Year ..etc. Data quality metrics and column statistics are computed for both for Quality traits data and NIRS Data.
Multiple smoothing methods are suggested for processing NIRS Data. Trait to be modeled is also displyed to capture user inputs (Trait of interest). 
Original vs processed data is initially displayed. few adjustements need to be made to fix the processed data output. 

next steps, analysis, calibration/test and make predictions.
